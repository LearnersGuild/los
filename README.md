# LOS

Central repository for LOS feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.

## How to Use this Repo

To submit a **bug report**, please create a new [issue](/issues/new) using the [issue template](./github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). Add the `bug` label to the issue.

To **give feedback or suggestions**, please also create an [issue](/issues/new), but you don't need to use the template (so you can delete the boilerplate text). Add the `suggestion` or `feedback` label to the issue.

Please be actionable, specific, and kind in your feedback. We'll reply to you as soon as we are able.
